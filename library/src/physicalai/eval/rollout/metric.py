    """TorchMetrics-based rollout evaluation metric for gym environments.

    This metric computes rollout statistics across multiple episodes with
    automatic distributed synchronization for multi-GPU training. It wraps
    the existing rollout functionality while providing torchmetrics benefits:
    - Automatic state synchronization across distributed processes
    - Integration with Lightning's metric logging system
    - Efficient tensor-based accumulation
    - Consistent API with other torchmetrics

    The metric tracks per-episode statistics and computes aggregated metrics
    across all episodes when compute() is called.

    Args:
        max_steps: Maximum steps per episode. If None, uses environment default.
        dist_sync_on_step: Whether to sync state across processes on each update.
            Default is False (sync only when compute() is called).
        **kwargs: Additional arguments passed to torchmetrics.Metric.

    Attributes:
        sum_rewards: Accumulated sum of all episode rewards
        max_rewards: Accumulated sum of max rewards per episode
        episode_lengths: Accumulated sum of episode lengths
        num_successes: Total number of successful episodes
        num_episodes: Total number of episodes evaluated
        all_sum_rewards: List of individual episode sum rewards
        all_max_rewards: List of individual episode max rewards
        all_episode_lengths: List of individual episode lengths
        all_successes: List of success flags for each episode

    Example:
        >>> from physicalai.eval.rollout import Rollout
        >>> metric = Rollout()
        >>> # During validation
        >>> for gym_env in val_dataloader:
