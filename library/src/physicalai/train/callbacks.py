class SnapFlowPhaseCallback(Callback):
    """Enable SnapFlow self-distillation at a phase boundary within a single training run.

    At the configured boundary the callback transitions the policy from standard
    flow-matching (phase 1) into SnapFlow distillation (phase 2) without
    requiring a second CLI invocation:

    - Calls ``policy.enable_snapflow(alpha, lambda_, num_inference_steps)``
      which activates the mixed FM/consistency loss and freezes the VLM
      backbone via the policy's existing ``set_requires_grad`` primitive.
    - Reconfigures the optimizer so it only covers the now-trainable
      parameters (action expert + target-time embedding), giving a clean
      optimizer state for phase 2.

    The boundary is expressed either in optimizer steps (``start_step``) or in
    epochs (``start_epoch``); exactly one must be given. Use ``start_epoch``
    when the run is budgeted with ``Trainer(max_epochs=...)`` so the boundary
    does not have to be converted to steps by hand.

    The policy must expose an ``enable_snapflow`` method — both
    :class:`~physicalai.policies.SmolVLA` and
    :class:`~physicalai.policies.Pi05` satisfy this contract.

    Phase 2 is made visible in three ways, so a run never switches objectives
    silently:

    - A console banner is printed at the boundary through the progress bar
      (tqdm-safe), or through ``logger.info`` when no progress bar is running.
    - ``snapflow`` is logged as a progress-bar metric for every phase-2 batch.
      It is deliberately not logged during phase 1, so the key's presence in the
      bar is itself the phase indicator.
    - Every :class:`~lightning.pytorch.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` filename
      template is prefixed with ``checkpoint_prefix`` from the boundary onwards,
      and the phase metadata is stamped into the checkpoint under a ``snapflow``
      key.

    Note:
        Reconfiguring the optimizer rebuilds the LR scheduler, so phase 2 starts
        with a fresh warmup. The cosine decay horizon is derived from
        ``Trainer.estimated_stepping_batches``, which reports the *total* run
        budget rather than the phase-2 remainder, so the phase-2 LR decays more
        slowly than a standalone phase-2 run would. Use two explicit
        ``physicalai fit`` runs if you need an exact phase-2 decay horizon.

    Note:
        The ``save_last`` checkpoint keeps its stock ``last.ckpt`` name across
        the boundary, so resuming always has a stable, phase-agnostic entry
        point. Use the checkpoint's ``snapflow`` metadata to tell which phase a
        given ``last.ckpt`` came from.

    Note:
        SnapFlow's shortcut target is bootstrapped from the model's own
        marginal-velocity predictions, so distilling an undertrained teacher
        distills noise. By default (``restore_best_teacher=True``), the
        callback restores the best-``val/loss`` weights from a monitored
        :class:`~lightning.pytorch.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint` *before* calling
        ``enable_snapflow()``, rather than distilling whatever the live
        in-memory model happens to be at the boundary. This requires a
        ``ModelCheckpoint(monitor=..., mode=...)`` among ``trainer.callbacks``;
        an unmonitored ``ModelCheckpoint`` (``monitor=None``) is ignored even if
        its ``best_model_path`` is populated, because ``best_model_path`` on an
        unmonitored checkpoint just means "most recent", not "best". If no
        monitored checkpoint is configured, or it has not saved yet, the
        callback warns and continues on the live weights. Set
        ``restore_best_teacher=False`` to always use the live weights and
        silence the warning.

    Note:
        ``val/loss`` is not comparable across the phase boundary: it measures
        full-denoising action MSE at ``num_inference_steps`` steps before
        activation, and at the (typically much lower, e.g. 1-NFE) SnapFlow
        ``num_inference_steps`` afterwards. By default
        (``scope_best_to_phase=True``), the callback resets every monitored
        ``ModelCheckpoint``'s best-tracking state at the boundary, so phase-2's
        best checkpoint is ranked only against other phase-2 checkpoints. The
        phase-1 best checkpoint file is preserved on disk (not deleted) as the
        distillation teacher's record. ``last.ckpt`` is unaffected. Set
        ``scope_best_to_phase=False`` to keep phase-1 scores in the running.

    Args:
        start_step: Optimizer step at which to activate SnapFlow. Mutually
            exclusive with ``start_epoch``.
        start_epoch: Epoch at which to activate SnapFlow, applied at the start
            of that epoch. Mutually exclusive with ``start_step``.
        alpha: Weight for the flow-matching loss branch (``L_FM``).
            Paper default: ``0.5``.
        lambda_: Scaling factor for the shortcut consistency loss
            (``L_shortcut``).  Paper default: ``0.1``.
        num_inference_steps: Denoising steps at inference time.
            Set to ``1`` for the full single-step SnapFlow speedup.
        checkpoint_prefix: Prefix applied to every ``ModelCheckpoint`` filename
            template once SnapFlow activates, so phase-1 and phase-2
            checkpoints are distinguishable on disk. Set to ``None`` to leave
            filenames untouched.
        restore_best_teacher: If ``True`` (default), restore the best-``val/loss``
            checkpoint from a monitored ``ModelCheckpoint`` before enabling
            SnapFlow. If ``False``, distill from the live in-memory model.
        best_teacher_monitor: Disambiguates which monitored ``ModelCheckpoint``
            to restore from when more than one is configured. Required (and
