"""Real-Time Chunking (RTC) mixins.

Provides a public, policy-level API for enabling or disabling Real-Time
Chunking (RTC) inference, and the model-level math that implements it. RTC
improves temporal consistency between consecutive action chunks by guiding the
denoising process with the unconsumed tail of the previous chunk.

:class:`RTCPolicyMixin` owns the RTC on/off state (the single source of truth)
and forwards it to the underlying :class:`RTCModelMixin` model's ``enable_rtc``
flag. Because policies may build their model lazily (e.g. during Lightning
``setup``), the desired state is cached on the policy and applied to the model
via :meth:`RTCPolicyMixin._sync_rtc_to_model` once the model exists. The state
is also written to (and restored from) Lightning checkpoints under the
``rtc_enabled`` key.

:class:`RTCModelMixin` carries that ``enable_rtc`` flag on the flow-matching
model together with the guidance correction applied at each denoising step.
