"""Shared SnapFlow self-distillation surface for flow-matching policies.

SnapFlow ([arXiv:2604.05656](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.05656)) compresses the
multi-step Euler denoising loop of a flow-matching VLA into a single forward
pass by self-distillation. It is trained in two phases: standard flow matching
first, then a short distillation phase with the VLM backbone frozen.

The target-time embedding and the ``nn.Module`` forward paths that are
``torch.compile``-wrapped and traced during export still live in each policy's
model. What this module owns is the surface that was otherwise duplicated
verbatim between :class:`~physicalai.policies.Pi05` and
:class:`~physicalai.policies.SmolVLA`:

- :class:`SnapFlowConfigMixin` — the four config flags and their validation.
- :class:`SnapFlowPolicyMixin` — the ``enable_snapflow()`` phase-2 entry point
  used by :class:`~physicalai.train.callbacks.SnapFlowPhaseCallback`.
- :class:`SnapFlowModelMixin` — the mixed FM/consistency-distillation training
  loss and the inference-time step-count/target-time selection, shared by each
  policy's flow-matching ``nn.Module``. A new flow matcher only needs to
  implement ``_predict_velocity`` (source-time, target-time conditioned
  velocity prediction) and a ``sample_noise`` callable to reuse it.

Example:
    >>> from physicalai.policies import Pi05
    >>> policy = Pi05(pretrained_name_or_path="lerobot/pi05_base")
    >>> policy.enable_snapflow(alpha=0.5, lambda_=0.1, num_inference_steps=1)  # doctest: +SKIP

        Splits the batch into a flow-matching (FM) fraction (``alpha``) and a

        uses the standard flow-matching objective (matching ``predict_velocity``

        under ``torch.compile``: with a data-dependent split, ``nonzero()`` and

        for nearly every step, which trips ``torch._dynamo.config.recompile_limit``
        and silently falls back to eager. With a static split size, Dynamo
        guards once on ``(alpha, bsize)`` and compiles a stable graph for the
