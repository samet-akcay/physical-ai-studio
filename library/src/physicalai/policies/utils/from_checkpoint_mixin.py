        """Load a policy from a Lightning checkpoint.

        This method loads the checkpoint, reconstructs the underlying model from the saved
        config, and restores the model weights.

        Args:
            checkpoint_path: Path to the checkpoint file (.ckpt).
            map_location: Device to map tensors to. If None, uses default device.
            **kwargs: Additional arguments passed to the policy constructor.

        Returns:
            Loaded policy with weights restored, ready for inference.

        Raises:
            KeyError: If checkpoint doesn't contain required model config.

        Examples:
            Load checkpoint for inference:

                >>> from physicalai.policies import ACT
                >>> policy = ACT.load_from_checkpoint("checkpoints/epoch=10.ckpt")
                >>> action = policy.select_action(observation)

            Load checkpoint to specific device:

                >>> policy = ACT.load_from_checkpoint(
                ...     "checkpoints/best.ckpt",
                ...     map_location="cuda:0",
                ... )

            Load checkpoint to CPU:

                >>> policy = ACT.load_from_checkpoint(
                ...     "checkpoints/best.ckpt",
