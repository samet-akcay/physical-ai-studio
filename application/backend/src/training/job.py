"""One training run, described by a spec and executed by one function.

:class:`TrainingJobSpec` is the complete configuration of a training run —
 policy, epoch budget, batch size, precision, device — and nothing else. It holds
no paths, no job identity, and no transport details, so the same spec can be
built in-process or sent over HTTP to a remote trainer and mean the same thing
in both places.

:func:`run_training_job` executes a spec: it builds the datamodule and policy,
runs Lightning, saves the final checkpoint into ``output_dir``, and exports the
policy to every backend it supports. Where the data comes from, where the
result goes, how progress is reported, and how cancellation is signalled are all
arguments — the runner owns none of that policy.

Example:
    >>> spec = TrainingJobSpec(policy="act", max_epochs=5, batch_size=8)
    >>> run_training_job(  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     spec,
    ...     dataset_root="/data/snapshot",
    ...     output_dir="/models/abc",
    ...     cache_dir="/cache/abc",
    ...     report=lambda progress, message, extra: None,
    ...     should_stop=lambda: False,

    written by the ``ModelCheckpoint`` callback during ``fit``; this function

    the checkpoint a distilled model ships.
