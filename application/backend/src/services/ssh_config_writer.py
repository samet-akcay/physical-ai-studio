"""Append-only writer for a new ``Host`` entry in ``~/.ssh/config``.

Pairs with :mod:`services.ssh_config_reader`: the reader stays read-only, this
module is the one place that ever appends an entry to the user's own SSH
config, so a user can add a host from the UI without hand-editing the file.

Same non-secret guarantee as the rest of the SSH feature: the only
credential-adjacent field accepted is ``identity_file``, a *path* the user
already has on disk. Studio never reads its contents, and nothing here writes
a key, password, or passphrase.

Never edits an existing entry: adding an alias that already exists in the
config is rejected with :class:`exceptions.ResourceAlreadyExistsError` rather
than merged or overwritten, so this module never has to parse and rewrite an
entry it did not create.

``add_verified_host_alias`` is the entry point everything above this module
should call: it never leaves an entry in the file that Studio has not itself
confirmed it can dial. A typo'd hostname, port, user, or key path is rejected
before it ever reaches the user's real ``~/.ssh/config``, the same way a
training-server save is gated on Tier 1 preflight before it reaches the
database.
