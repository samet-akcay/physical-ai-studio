"""In-process training backend using torch/Lightning.

This is an adapter, not a training implementation: it maps a `TrainingContext`
onto a `training.TrainingJobSpec` and hands it to `training.run_training_job`,
the same runner the trainer service uses. Keeping the training logic in one
place is what stops the local and remote paths from drifting apart.

Imports of `physicalai`, torch, and Lightning are deferred to call time so this
module can be imported in environments without the `[train]` extra installed.
