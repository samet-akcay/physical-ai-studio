"""Phase-windowed progress reporting shared by remote training backends.

A remote SSH job has more phases than a local or direct-URL run (connect,
image pull, image verification, trainer start) layered on top of the existing
upload -> train -> download. This module extends the existing progress model
(``ProgressReporter(progress, message, extra_info)``) rather than changing its
contract: each phase owns a slice of the 0-100 bar, and a structured
descriptor rides inside the existing ``extra_info["phase"]`` dict so the UI
can render a stepper while the plain bar still drives unaware consumers.

Local and direct-URL backends are untouched by this module: they keep their
own ``SNAPSHOT_UPLOAD_PROGRESS`` / ``TRAINING_PROGRESS_END`` windows in
``services.training_backends.remote`` and never attach a ``phase`` descriptor.
This table is selected only by ``services.training_backends.ssh.SshTrainingBackend``.

``PHASE_TABLE_VERSION`` and ``PhaseKey`` must stay in lockstep with whatever
the UI consumes, so both sides drift together rather than silently apart.

Window order deliberately follows `SshProvisioningService.provision`'s real
execution order (verify the image's signature *before* ever pulling it, so an
unsigned/tampered image is never fetched at all) rather than the earlier,
purely descriptive "image pull, then verification" ordering: image
verification runs, then the (indeterminate) pull, then the trainer container
is launched.
