"""Startup recovery for SSH-provisioned training jobs.

Runs once at studio startup, before the generic orphan-job abort in
`services.training_service.TrainingService.abort_orphan_jobs`. Fails closed
like the other SSH gates: if `core.security.get_ssh_feature_availability`
reports the feature inactive, this never dials SSH or touches a container -
every `JobProvisioningDB` row is left untouched for a future pass.

For every non-terminal job with a persisted `JobProvisioningDB` row while the
feature is active, `recover_ssh_jobs`:

1. Reconciles stale rows - a row whose job already reached a terminal state,
   left behind by a crash between stopping a container and deleting its row.
2. Verifies every remaining row's container with
   `SshProvisioningService.verify_reattach`, and requeues (`PENDING`) or fails
   the job depending on the outcome (see `ReattachFailureReason`).
3. Sweeps orphan containers per configured server, excluding every job this
   pass just confirmed or left pending - so a container reattach is about to
   claim is never swept out from under it.

Step order matters: sweeping runs last, and only after every non-terminal
job's container has had a chance to be recognized as still claimed.

Every job with a provisioning row is explicitly resolved here - confirmed,
left pending for retry, or failed - so the caller must skip all of them
(`SshRecoveryReport.handled_job_ids`) when it runs the generic orphan abort
right after. That generic pass only inspects a job's own persisted
``remote_job_id``, which an SSH job may not have recorded yet even though its
container was just confirmed healthy (e.g. a crash between provisioning and
the trainer job actually being submitted); without the exclusion it would
re-judge and incorrectly fail a job this module already decided to keep.
