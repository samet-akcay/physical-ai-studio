"""Docker image resolution, verification, GPU-busy waiting, and container lifecycle.

Everything here runs a command over an already-connected
:class:`~services.ssh.transport.SshTransport`. No function opens or closes a
connection: :mod:`services.ssh.provisioning` owns connection lifetime.

Image resolution never pulls a layer: ``docker buildx imagetools inspect``
reads the registry manifest and image-config labels (including the
`physicalai-train` version) over the registry API, so a version-policy
rejection never costs a multi-gigabyte transfer.

``verify_image_signature`` is the one exception to "everything here runs over
SSH": it runs on this backend's own host using the `sigstore` PyPI package
rather than a `cosign` binary. See `services.ssh.sigstore_verify`.
