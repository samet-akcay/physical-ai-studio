"""Provision, reattach to, and tear down per-job SSH trainer containers.

This is the top-level orchestrator for SSH-provisioned remote training: it
resolves and verifies the trainer image, waits out a busy GPU, re-checks disk
against the job's real snapshot size, launches a least-privilege container,
opens the SSH tunnel to it, verifies readiness, and persists enough state
(:mod:`schemas.job_provisioning`) that a crashed studio can reattach instead of
losing track of a still-running container.

Wiring this into job dispatch (``get_training_backend`` / ``TrainingWorker``)
is a later step; this module is usable standalone against a
:class:`~repositories.job_provisioning_repo.JobProvisioningRepository` and a
:class:`~schemas.remote_server.RemoteServer`.
