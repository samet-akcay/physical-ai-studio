"""SSH remote-execution boundary for SSH-provisioned remote training servers.

Everything that runs a command on a user's GPU box goes through this package:

* :mod:`services.ssh.transport` owns the connection, argument quoting, the
  bounded timeouts, and the mapping from ``asyncssh`` failures to actionable
  Studio exceptions that carry no host or key detail.
* :mod:`services.ssh.preflight` owns the two-tier verification built on top of it.
* :mod:`services.ssh.sanitize` strips and caps remote output before any of it
  reaches an API response.

Studio never receives, reads, stores, or transports SSH key material. A remote
server is identified only by a non-secret ``ssh_host_alias``, and ``asyncssh``
resolves that alias against the user's own ``~/.ssh/config`` and verifies the host
against their own ``~/.ssh/known_hosts``.
