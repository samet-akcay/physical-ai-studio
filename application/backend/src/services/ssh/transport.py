"""Async SSH transport for SSH-provisioned remote training servers.

This module is the remote-execution trust boundary. Everything crossing it is
constrained here rather than at the call sites:

* **Credentials stay with the user.** ``asyncssh`` is handed the user's own
  ``~/.ssh/config`` and ``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` and resolves the alias itself.
  Studio never reads, stores, or transports key material.
* **Commands are built from argument lists.** :meth:`SshTransport.run_command`
  takes ``argv`` and shell-quotes it with :func:`shlex.join`. SSH's ``exec``
  channel is string-based at the protocol level, so quoting each argument is
  what makes an argument unable to break out of its position.
* **Failures map to actionable errors.** Every ``asyncssh`` connect/auth failure
  becomes one of the ``Ssh*Error`` classes in :mod:`exceptions`, and none of them
  carry raw ``asyncssh`` exception text: a raw SSH error can contain the resolved
  hostname or an identity path, neither of which belongs in an API response.
* **Output is sanitized.** ``stdout``/``stderr`` on a :class:`CommandResult` have
  already been through :func:`services.ssh.sanitize.sanitize_output`, so remote
  output cannot carry escape sequences or unbounded length into a job message.
* **Everything is bounded.** Connect, command, per-alias concurrency, and
  per-alias connect rate all have caps from :class:`settings.Settings`.

Host-key unknown vs. changed
----------------------------
``asyncssh`` Raises the same :class:`asyncssh.HostKeyNotVerifiable` for a host
  absent from ``known_hosts`` and for a host whose key changed - both arrive as
``ValueError('Host key is not trusted')`` inside
``SSHClientConnection.validate_server_host_key``. To tell them apart, this module
installs a callable ``known_hosts`` matcher that wraps
:func:`asyncssh.match_known_hosts` and records how many entries matched the host
before verification ran. No matching entry means the host was never accepted
(unknown); entries that matched while verification still failed means the
presented key differs from the accepted one (mismatch). An ambiguous case fails
closed as a mismatch, the more suspicious interpretation.
