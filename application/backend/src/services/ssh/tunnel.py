"""SSH local-forward tunnel to an SSH-provisioned trainer container.

The tunnel is the only path a studio process ever reaches a provisioned
trainer through: the container publishes on its host's loopback interface
only, and :class:`SshTunnel` forwards a local loopback port to it over the
same SSH connection class the rest of :mod:`services.ssh` uses. A dropped
tunnel reconnects and re-forwards against the still-running container within a
bounded retry budget, so a flaky network path never fails a job that is
otherwise progressing fine.
