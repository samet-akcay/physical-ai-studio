"""add remote_servers.last_check_checks

Persists the per-check detail (image resolution, signature, device probe,
protocol) of the most recent Tier 2 ``/check`` run alongside the existing
``last_check_*`` summary columns. Previously only the rolled-up summary was
stored, so the "Image pull & verification" card had nothing to render after a
page refresh and always reset to "Not verified yet" even though the server
was last verified successfully.
