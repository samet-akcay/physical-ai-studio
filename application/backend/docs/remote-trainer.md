# Physical AI Trainer

Remote training service for Physical AI Studio. Runs the heavy
torch/`physicalai` training stack on a GPU server so recording nodes stay
lightweight.

It lives in this project (`src/trainer/`) but is a separate entry point:
`physicalai-trainer` serves training jobs over HTTP, while `physicalai-studio`
serves the studio itself. Both call the same training code
(`training.run_training_job`), so a policy trains identically whether it
runs locally or here. Studio's own local training does not start this service —
it trains in-process.

## How it fits together

The studio backend delivers the dataset snapshot to this service by zipping it
and streaming it straight to `PUT /jobs/{id}/dataset` over HTTP, once a job is
submitted against a remote trainer registered in the Studio UI/API.

Then:

1. The service queues the job and trains, exports, and zips the model.
2. The backend polls progress, downloads the archive, and imports it as a model.
3. The service deletes the uploaded dataset once the job finishes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A Hugging Face token is resolved once by the Studio backend (Settings page,
> or a legacy `HF_TOKEN` in the Studio backend's own environment) and sent
> per-job in the `POST /jobs` body (`hf_token`), cached in memory only for
> that job (see `trainer.store.JobStore.stash_secret`/`take_secret`), and never
> written to disk. This service's own `HF_TOKEN` environment variable (see
> [Optional Hugging Face token](#optional-hugging-face-token) below) is only a
> *fallback* used when the studio sends none for a job - it is left untouched
> and used as-is whenever the studio doesn't send one, but is never itself
> forwarded to the studio, and is overridden for the duration of any job the
> studio *does* send a token for. **SSH-provisioned trainer containers never
> receive any environment variables at launch at all** (see
> `services.ssh.docker_ops.build_run_argv`), so that fallback does not exist
> for them - the Studio Settings page is the *only* place a token can come
> from for an SSH-provisioned job.

## Install

```bash
cd application/backend
uv sync --extra cuda   # or --extra cpu / --extra xpu
```

The `cpu` and `cuda` extras include `executorch`, enabling the ExecuTorch
export backend. The `xpu` extra omits it: executorch conflicts with the xpu
torch build, so ExecuTorch export is skipped on xpu installs.

## Configure

Set environment variables, or copy `.env.example` to `.env` in
`application/backend/` and fill it in — the same file the studio backend
reads. The trainer's own settings use `TRAINER_`-prefixed names
(`TRAINER_HOST`, `TRAINER_PORT`, `TRAINER_STORAGE_DIR`) rather than the
studio's `HOST`/`PORT`/`STORAGE_DIR`, so one file configures both without the
trainer binding the studio's port or writing into the studio's storage
directory.

> [!WARNING]
> The trainer has no built-in authentication. Anyone who can reach its port can submit or cancel jobs and download model artifacts. Keep it on a private network that only the Physical AI Studio backend IP address can reach—never expose it to the internet.

> The backend honors `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`. A configured proxy receives all trainer traffic, including model artifact downloads; anyone who controls these variables controls where artifacts go. Run the backend only on a trusted, non-shared, non-multi-tenant host where other users cannot set them.

| Variable                     | Required | Description                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `HF_TOKEN`                   | no       | Fallback used only when the studio sends no token for a job (see the [!IMPORTANT] note above); has no effect for SSH-provisioned trainers. |
| `TRAINER_STORAGE_DIR`        | no       | Working directory for jobs and artifacts.    |
| `TRAINER_MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS`| no       | Queue concurrency (default 1).               |
| `TRAINER_MAX_UNCOMPRESSED_BYTES` | no   | Cap on an uploaded dataset's uncompressed size. |
| `TRAINER_MIN_FREE_BYTES`     | no       | Disk headroom kept free after extraction.    |
| `TRAINER_PORT`               | no       | Listen port (default 8001).                  |

## Run

```bash
uv run --no-sync physicalai-trainer   # loads .env, starts the service
```

`physicalai-trainer` loads `.env` and starts the service. It does
not install dependencies itself, so run `uv sync --extra <cpu|cuda|xpu>` first
(see [Install](#install)) to pull in the matching torch build.

Use `--no-sync` so the run reuses that install. A plain `uv run` triggers an
implicit sync that ignores the hardware extra and can re-resolve `torch` from
the default index, clobbering your `cuda`/`xpu` build. If you prefer not to pass
the flag every time, either export `UV_NO_SYNC=1`, or repeat the extra on the
run command so the resolution matches:

```bash
uv run --extra cuda physicalai-trainer   # or --extra xpu / --extra cpu
```

Override the bind address with flags:

```bash
uv run --no-sync physicalai-trainer --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

To run the ASGI app module directly:

```bash
uv run --no-sync python -m trainer.main
```

### Running over SSH

If you start the trainer from an SSH session, run it inside `tmux` (or with
`nohup`) so the process keeps running when the connection drops. A plain
foreground `uv run` is a child of the SSH session: losing the connection sends
it `SIGHUP` and kills the training job along with it.

`tmux`:

```bash
tmux new -s physicalai-trainer
uv run --no-sync physicalai-trainer
# detach with Ctrl-b d; reattach later with: tmux attach -t physicalai-trainer
```

`nohup`:

```bash
nohup uv run --no-sync physicalai-trainer > trainer.log 2>&1 &
disown
```

The [container images](#container-images) below run detached with `docker
run -d` or `docker compose up -d`, so they are unaffected by SSH disconnects.
This only matters for the bare `uv run` / `python -m trainer.main`
invocations above.

## Container images

Remote SSH provisioning uses the dedicated, non-root trainer images instead of
the Studio application images:

- `ghcr.io/open-edge-platform/physicalai-trainer-cuda:<version>-dev-<short-sha>`
- `ghcr.io/open-edge-platform/physicalai-trainer-xpu:<version>-dev-<short-sha>`

Each image contains only the `trainer` package, `physicalai-train`, and the
device-specific runtime dependencies. Although the trainer is built from this
project, the image copies `src/trainer/` alone: no Studio API, robot, database,
or UI code, and no datasets, model artifacts, SSH credentials, or Docker socket.
The entrypoint is `physicalai-trainer`; run it with a loopback-only port
publishing rule when it is provisioned remotely.

The image is built from
[`application/docker/Dockerfile.trainer`](../../docker/Dockerfile.trainer),
separately from the Studio application images in
`application/docker/Dockerfile`.

CI publishes a `<version>-dev-<short-sha>` tag and the moving `main` tag
together, then attaches an SBOM and provenance attestations to the immutable
tag and signs it with keyless Sigstore. `protocol-<N>` only advances after
that signing succeeds, so a failed attestation or signing step leaves it
pointing at the previous good build instead of an unsigned one. Use the
`<version>-dev-<short-sha>` tag or a resolved digest for reproducible
deployments; `main` and `protocol-<N>` are moving compatibility fallbacks
only.

Published tags:

| Tag                         | Advanced by          | Points at                                   |
| --------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `<version>-dev-<short-sha>` | every push to `main` | that exact commit (immutable)               |
| `main`                      | every push to `main` | newest `main` build                          |
| `protocol-<N>`              | every push to `main` | newest signed build for the `N` compiled into that push's `TRAINER_API_PROTOCOL_VERSION` (older `protocol-<N>` values stop advancing once the workflow bumps the version) |

Release channels (`X.Y.Z`, `latest`) are not published yet: `trainer-images.yml`
has no release trigger, so every published trainer image is a development build.
Trivy scanning of published trainer images runs on the nightly
`security-scan.yml` schedule rather than gating publish.

`GET /health` returns the image attributes that the Studio backend verifies
before work is accepted:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "protocol_version": 1,
  "device_type": "cuda",
  "build_revision": "<git-sha>",
  "build_date": "<RFC 3339 timestamp>",
  "application_version": "<version>"
}
```

### Run a container manually

Use manual startup only for administrator validation or the existing static
remote-trainer workflow. SSH-provisioned jobs will create a job-scoped
container, loopback port, and SSH tunnel automatically when that feature is
enabled. Do not expose the trainer port publicly: the service has no built-in
authentication.

[`application/docker/docker-compose.trainer.yaml`](../../docker/docker-compose.trainer.yaml)
wraps the `docker run` invocations below in a Docker Compose file with `cuda`
and `xpu` profiles, for administrators who prefer Compose over raw `docker
run`. It is standalone: it does not start the Studio backend/UI images from
`application/docker/docker-compose.yaml`.

```bash
cd application/docker
cp .env.trainer.example .env.trainer   # then edit REGISTRY/TRAINER_IMAGE_TAG
docker compose -f docker-compose.trainer.yaml --profile cuda up -d   # or --profile xpu
curl --fail --silent http://127.0.0.1:8001/health
docker compose -f docker-compose.trainer.yaml --profile cuda down   # add -v to also drop the data volume
```

Set `TRAINER_IMAGE_TAG` in `.env.trainer` to an immutable
`<version>-dev-<short-sha>` tag or resolved digest before using this in
anything but a throwaway environment; the default `main` tag moves (see
[Container images](#container-images) for what each tag tracks). For the XPU
profile, also uncomment the `devices`/`group_add` entries under
`physicalai-trainer-xpu` in `docker-compose.trainer.yaml` and set
`RENDER_NODE`/`RENDER_GID` to the host's Intel GPU render node (see
`.env.trainer.example`). They're commented out by default because Docker
Compose evaluates `${RENDER_GID:?...}` for every service in the file — left
active, it would also block `--profile cuda` runs when `RENDER_GID` isn't set.

The examples below use a Docker-managed volume so the image's non-root
`trainer` user can persist its queue, uploaded datasets, and artifacts
without host ownership changes. Remove the volume after you no longer need
its contents.

```bash
docker volume create physicalai-trainer-data
```

Replace `<image-reference>` with an immutable `<version>-dev-<short-sha>`
tag or a resolved digest. Use `main` only when explicitly accepting a moving tag.

PyTorch data loaders can exhaust Docker's default 64 MB `/dev/shm` allocation
during larger training jobs. On a trusted single-tenant host, prefer the host's
shared-memory pool with `--ipc=host` (or `ipc: host` in Docker Compose). If you
need an isolated limit instead, set an explicit shared-memory size such as
`--shm-size=16g` (or `shm_size: 16g` in Docker Compose).

#### CUDA

The Docker host needs an NVIDIA driver and NVIDIA Container Toolkit. Verify the
host can grant GPU access with a disposable CUDA container before starting the
trainer.

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all \
  nvidia/cuda:12.8.0-base-ubuntu24.04 \
  nvidia-smi
```

Start the trainer with GPU access and a loopback-only port binding:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name physicalai-trainer \
  --gpus all \
  --ipc=host \
  --read-only \
  --tmpfs /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=1g \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8001:8001 \
  -v physicalai-trainer-data:/var/lib/physicalai-trainer \
  ghcr.io/open-edge-platform/physicalai-trainer-cuda:<image-reference>
```

#### XPU

The Docker host needs a supported Intel GPU driver and an accessible
`/dev/dri/renderD*` device. Set `RENDER_NODE` to the render node on your host;
the numeric group is passed through so the non-root trainer user can access it.

```bash
export RENDER_NODE=/dev/dri/renderD128
test -c "$RENDER_NODE"
export RENDER_GID="$(stat -c '%g' "$RENDER_NODE")"

docker run -d \
  --name physicalai-trainer \
  --device /dev/dri:/dev/dri \
  --group-add "$RENDER_GID" \
  --ipc=host \
  --read-only \
  --tmpfs /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=1g \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8001:8001 \
  -v physicalai-trainer-data:/var/lib/physicalai-trainer \
  ghcr.io/open-edge-platform/physicalai-trainer-xpu:<image-reference>
```

Do not use `--privileged` or mount the Docker socket for either image.

#### Optional Hugging Face token

Only relevant for a manually-run/direct-URL trainer (see [Run a container
manually](#run-a-container-manually)): SSH-provisioned trainer containers
never receive this or any other environment variable at launch, so setting it
there has no effect - use the Studio Settings page instead (see the
[!IMPORTANT] note under [How it fits together](#how-it-fits-together)).

Set `HF_TOKEN` only when you train a policy that downloads gated/private
model weights. Place a read-only token in a host file with restrictive
permissions and pass it as an environment file:

```bash
printf 'HF_TOKEN=<read-only-token>\n' > trainer.env
chmod 600 trainer.env
```

Add this option to the appropriate `docker run` command, before the image
reference:

```bash
--env-file ./trainer.env
```

Never commit `trainer.env` or put a token directly in shell history.

#### Verify and stop

Verify the running image before pointing Studio at it. The reported device,
protocol, and build revision must match the image you selected.

```bash
curl --fail --silent http://127.0.0.1:8001/health
```

Stop a manually managed trainer and remove its retained data when it is no
longer needed:

```bash
docker stop physicalai-trainer
docker rm physicalai-trainer
docker volume rm physicalai-trainer-data
```

## Security

- HTTP-uploaded datasets are validated before extraction: ZIP-only, size and
  file-count caps, disk-headroom check, and per-entry path containment (no
  traversal, symlinks, or nested archives).
